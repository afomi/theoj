# The Open Journal

What is this? In short, it's an open review engine for digital media. The goal is to provide a way for a bunch of people to get together (think editorial board) and make comments on a _thing_ (think academic paper). This _thing_ only needs to have a URL (that's open) to be reviewable.

Simple eh?

## Does it work? Is it green?

Hopefully/probably?
