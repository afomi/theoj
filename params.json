The goal is to provide a way for a bunch of people to get together (think editorial board) and make comments on a _thing_ (think academic paper). This _thing_ only needs to have a URL (that's open) to be reviewable.\r\n\r\nSimple eh?\r\n\r\n## Does it work?\r\n\r\n### Current status\r\n\r\nRight now there is only a Ruby logic layer under development. This is the core permission layer we think is important for defining differences between *Authors*, *Editors* and *Reviewers*.\r\n\r\nOnce this is finished up we'll be adding in a lightweight presentation layer that will make this a more fully-fledged web application.\r\n\r\n### Is it green?\r\n\r\nHopefully/probably? You can keep an eye on Travis stuff here:\r\n\r\n[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/arfon/theoj.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/arfon/theoj)\r\n","google":"UA-47852178-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
