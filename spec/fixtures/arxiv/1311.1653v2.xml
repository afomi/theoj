    <title>A photometric comprehensive study of circumnuclear star forming rings:
  the sample</title>
    <summary>  We present photometry in U, B, V, R and I continuum bands and in H{\alpha}
and H{\beta} emission lines for a sample of 336 circumnuclear star forming
regions (CNSFR) located in 20 early type spiral galaxies with different levels
of activity in their nuclei. This reported activity ranges from Sy1 to
Starburst, including Sy2 and LINER. They are nearby galaxies, with distances
less than 100 Mpc, $60\%$ of which are considered as interacting objects. We
have found a clear relationship between MB of the galaxy and the major axis of
the rings based on data from a wide sample of galaxies with outer, inner and
circumnuclear rings. This relationship allows us to define the "limiting
radius" for each galaxy as the radius beyond which, HII regions should not be
considered as circumnuclear. This concept of "limiting radius" allows to
ascertain whether an HII region close to the galactic nucleus can be considered
circumnuclear or not. Extinction corrected H{\alpha}luminosities range from 1.3
10^38 to 4 10^41 erg s-1. H{\alpha} and H{\beta} images have allowed us to
obtain an accurate measure of extinction. Av varies around an average value of
1.85 magnitudes. Most of the regions are placed around (U-B) \simeq -0.7, while
a second maximum value appears at (U-B) \simeq -0.3. (R-I) also presents a
bimodal behaviour, with two peaks located close to the values 0.6 and 0.9. As
in the previous case, reddest regions appear in non-interacting galaxies.
Interestingly enough, for a significant number of HII regions the observed
colours and equivalent widths are not well reproduced by evolutionary
theoretical models of a single burst. To disentangle if we are dealing with
compound star populations or just mismatching metallicity or extinction
effects, a deeper study using different theoretical evolutionary models has
been carried and will be presented in a second paper.
